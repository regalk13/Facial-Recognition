# Facial-Recognition
## _Python Facial Recognition_

This is a Python facial recognition, use Opencv and numpy to collect data, use it but read the instructions first.

## Features

- It reads your face by taking multiple photos with Opencv technology and collects all the data in one .npy file to use for facial recognition.
- All in a single file for each person.
- You can save the data of thousands of people.
- Easy implementation to other projects.

## Tech

Here you will find out the technologies used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - All code on python!
- [Opencv](https://opencv.org/) - Awesome open library, and powerful.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - To save data in amazing ways and with good practices.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - The whole Project uses git for version control.


There are few technologies but I think they are necessary for a great solution.

## Installation

You will need python 3.8.x (open a virtual environment as good practice and install opencv and numpy).

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```
```sh
pip install numpy
```

## How to use
When you have the dependencies installed, remember to put your webcam focusing on your face and in a bright place with no other people.

- Run face-data.py - This begins to analyze your face, you will see numbers printing on the screen, recommended that you leave it up to 40, when you think it is okay press Q.
- Verify on the folder face_dataset have a .npy file with the name you put on face_data.py.
- Run face_recognition.py, A box will appear with the name of the person who detects.
